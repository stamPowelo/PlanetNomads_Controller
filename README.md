# Planet Nomads XBOX ONE Controller Support
AntiMicro profile for XBOX_One Controller

Planet Nomads has many functionalities for the player and makes it very difficult to use a gamepad. It has already some connexions to the XBOX-ONE controller (Windows 10), which you cannot over-pass them.

This micro-project is with respect to the developers of PLANET NOMADS and their amazing game.
I hope they will make the game with full controller support soon.

Just leaving 2 hyperlinks to the Antimicro software and the game in steam.

bugs, and honest feedback will be appreciated. Have fun with!
